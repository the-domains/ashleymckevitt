An admirer of visual grids and beautiful contrast.
Obsessed with the details (picas and kerning and masking- oh my!).
Sings off-key during road trips, but knows all the words.
Always misplacing my keys. 
And phone. And wallet. Oops.
Most importantly? I'm passionate about developing creative content that is impactful. 
Currently living in Brooklyn, looking for my next adventure.
